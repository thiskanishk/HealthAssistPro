# AI Features Guide

## Symptom Analysis

The system uses advanced AI models to analyze patient symptoms and provide diagnostic suggestions. The AI takes into account:

- Patient symptoms
- Medical history
- Vital signs
- Lab results
- Current medications

### Confidence Levels

The AI provides confidence levels for each diagnosis suggestion:
- High (>80%): Strong correlation with symptoms
- Medium (50-80%): Moderate correlation
- Low (<50%): Possible but requires further investigation

### Implementation Example

```typescript
const diagnosisResult = await aiService.analyzeSymptons({
  symptoms: string[],
  patientHistory: PatientHistory,
  vitalSigns: VitalSigns
});
```

## Prescription Suggestions

The AI assists in prescription management by:
- Checking drug interactions
- Verifying dosage based on patient data
- Suggesting alternative medications
- Monitoring for contraindications
