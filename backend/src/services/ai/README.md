# AI-Powered Medication and Treatment Services

This directory contains services related to AI-powered medication suggestions, drug interaction detection, and treatment recommendations.

## Core Services

### PrescriptionSuggestionService

Provides AI-powered medication prescription suggestions based on patient data, diagnosis, and symptoms. The service ensures safety by:

- Validating medication choices against established treatment guidelines
- Detecting potential drug interactions with current medications
- Checking for contraindications based on patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Applying Beers Criteria for elderly patients
- Validating dosages against recommended guidelines
- Flagging prescriptions that require manual review

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { prescriptionService } from './services/ai/PrescriptionSuggestionService';

// Generate prescription suggestions
const suggestions = await prescriptionService.suggestPrescription({
  diagnosis: 'Hypertension',
  symptoms: ['headache', 'dizziness'],
  patientData: {
    age: 65,
    weight: 70,
    gender: 'male',
    allergies: ['penicillin'],
    currentMedications: ['Metformin'],
    chronicConditions: ['Type 2 Diabetes']
  },
  vitalSigns: {
    bloodPressure: '150/95',
    heartRate: 88,
    temperature: 37.2
  }
});
```

### DrugInteractionService

Detects potential interactions between medications. It uses both a pre-populated database of known interactions and AI-assisted analysis for novel combinations.

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { DrugInteractionService } from './services/ai/DrugInteractionService';

// Get singleton instance
const service = DrugInteractionService.getInstance();

// Check for interactions
const interactions = await service.checkInteractions(
  'Lisinopril',
  ['Spironolactone', 'Aspirin']
);
```

### Treatment Recommender
